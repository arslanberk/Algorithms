# Algorithms
This repository contains sample codes for different algorithms, such as;
- Erosion Algorithm
- Median Filter Algorithm

# NoiseReduction
- **Erosion Algorithm** to find edges of the shape in the image file. Erosion is one of the two basic operators in the area of mathematical morphology, the other being dilation. 
- **Median Filter Algorithm** to remove noise. The median filter is a nonlinear digital filtering technique, often used to remove noise.
